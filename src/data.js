        description: "Orange labradorite wrapped in woven, oxidized, and hand- polished solid copper wire./nIn addition to its numerous other abilities, labradorite strengthens intuition, therefore leaving the mind more receptive to psychic abilities. This stone will help you banish fears and insecurities and put your trust in the universe. Labradorite’s “flash” is actually a phenomenon called labradoresence, which allows us to enjoy the whole rainbow of labradorite./nThis particular piece of labradorite is one of my favorites ever. Local pickup is available. 20” black cord is included.",
