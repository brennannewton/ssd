                        <p>In 2018, I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder. I had all this manic energy, so I decided to channel it into making new jewelry out of old jewelry. I began searching for discarded beauty in the world and giving it new life. After learning the basics of wire wrapping, I transformed my passion and skills into a business - Second Sight Design.</p>

                        <h5 className="info-title">My Mission</h5>
                        <p>Simply put, I want to spread crystals to people. While doing so, I want to remind people the power of second chances. This business gives me, old jewelry, and the planet a second chance with every piece thatâ€™s crafted.</p>
                        <h5 className="info-title mt-5">My Vision</h5>
                        <p>I eventually want to be a gallery artist and create high-end designs to make my work more accessible. I also want to start silversmithing, which will give my customers more options as my business expands.</p>
